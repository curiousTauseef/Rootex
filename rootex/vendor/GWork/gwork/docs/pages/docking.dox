I always feel like I learn better by looking at images rather than text.
So here goes (this is in GWEN but it"s the same principle in GMod).

### New Window

### New Button called Bart

### Dock Bart "Left"

### Change Homer's Margin (0,0,4,0) (l,u,r,d)

### Create Button ":D" on Homer, Dock "Bottom"

### Change :D margin to (4,4,4,4)

As you can see it makes laying out your controls set and forget. Previously
you'd be setting the layout in something like PerformLayout - manually
working out pixels, subtracting from the width of the parent. It gets messy.

Docking isn't appropriate for everything but it works for a lot of stuff.
It also has the advantage that it automatically scales when stuff gets resized.
